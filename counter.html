            During the COVID-19 2020 Pandemic, our way of life changed in many ways. 
            This lead to many creative ways for people to connect from a distance,
            something that would be essential during the months apart where little
            social interaction was had. 
            <br /><br />
            One of the ways we developed was the QR code. 
            <br /><br />
            While this small bit of technology was introduced in 1994, they reached a peak 
            popularity in 2020 due to their accessability and ability to contribute to the 
            distance rule put into effect during the pandemic.
            <br /><br />
            These lead to intially unthought of goldmine for scammers. Due to how QR codes 
            utilize hyperlinks, they act nearly exactly like regular links that you might
            click on in a word document. This can lead to scammer/hackers gaining access or
            sensitive personal information if the user is not careful. It makes it rather
            easy to trick the users, something profound during the Pandemic.
